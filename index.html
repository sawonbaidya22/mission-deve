                A nine-time GiveWell top charity, our Deworm the World Initiative combats worm infections by working
                with governments to deliver mass school-based deworming programs.

                Since 2014, we have supported governments to implement high quality programming, helping treat over 280
                million children in 2019. Deworming is proven to improve the nutrition, cognition, school attendance,
                and long-term economic prospects of children. </p>
