                another country.

            <h1>Vision</h1>
            <p>Your vision of a future situation or society is what you imagine or hope it would be like, if things
                were
                very different from the way they are now.
                I have a vision of a society that is free of exploitation and injustice. [+ of]
                That's my vision of how the world could be. [+ of]
                Turning that vision into a practical reality is not easy.</p>

                You’re tired of second-guessing if your professional development efforts are meeting the mark. You’re
                ready to build the professional learning your people need in order to be effective with young people.

                Time is of the essence. Young people need high-quality programming now more than ever. Your funders and
                partners are requesting your services. Now you must ensure that the teams on the ground have the
                knowledge and skills they need for successful implementation.

                A nine-time GiveWell top charity, our Deworm the World Initiative combats worm infections by working
                with governments to deliver mass school-based deworming programs.

                Since 2014, we have supported governments to implement high quality programming, helping treat over 280
                million children in 2019. Deworming is proven to improve the nutrition, cognition, school attendance,
                and long-term economic prospects of children. </p>
